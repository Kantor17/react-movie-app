# kantor17-REACT2022Q3
This project is a part of [RSS React course](https://github.com/rolling-scopes-school/tasks/tree/master/react) and is designed to cover all the fundamental parts of React. It consists of 6 modules, you can learn more about each of them in the "Pull Requests" tab.   
P.S: Unfortunately, I got out of the course's track because of the terroristic bombings of my country and other personal issues, therefore I have violated deadlines starting from module 3 and finished them later.
